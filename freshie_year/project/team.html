<br>
<b>ABOUT PATTY SHIN = </b>
<br>
<br>
Patty Shin is the owner as well as the C.E.O of Cassiopeia Incorporated. She looks
<br>
over the management and makes sure that the budget has not been exceeded and she is
<br>
also responsible for introducing new products as she sees fit. Patty Shin has been
<br>
with the company for eighteen long years, since 1989. It had been a desire of hers to 
<br>
make Miss Kim's dream of expanding and opening new stores all over the country, come
<br>
true. Patty's favorite memory in Cassiopeia Incorporated was when she first met 
<br>
with Miss Jinjoo "Pearl" Kim before she passed away. It was an exciting and inspirational
<br>
moment for her.

<br>
<br>
<b>ABOUT JENNY SHEN =</b>
<br>
<br>
Jenny Shen has been with Cassiopeia Incorporated since Patty Shin had taken leadership
<br>
of the company back in 1989. Though she is an executive, she acts almost as a Vice President
<br>
of Cassiopeia Incorporated, working alongside Ms.Shin personally. If there is ever a time
<br>
when Ms.Shin is unable to attend a meeting or personally attend to a problem, Jenny Shen 
<br>
takes over her position temporarily in order to meet these needs. One of her favorite memories
<br>
with Cassiopeia is when she and Patty Shin took a roadtrip over to San Francisco from Los Angelos
<br>
where they got lost for a couple hours trying to attend a business meeting. It was during that 
<br>
time that they really bonded.

<br>
<br>
<b>ABOUT CHANGMIN KIM =</b>
<br>
<br>
Changmin Shim has been an excellent part of the Cassiopeia Incorporated team. His innovative

mind is always thinking of new ways to help out with the company. Mr.Shim's main job
<br>
within the company is to come up with new ways to present and advertise Cassiopeia Incorporated.
<br>
He has been employed by Cassiopeia since about the year 2000, about seven years. One of Mr.Shim's favorite
<br>
memories is when he first started working for us, and the company had to host a party that was celebrating
<br>
the opening of a new "Cassiopeia" store over in New York City. He had a blast at the party, and was able
<br>
to meet so many new people.
