<br>	
	Welcome to Cassiopeia Incorporated Online! We thank you for showing your interest in our company by visiting
<br>
our site online! Though our company is fairly small at the moment, we hope to become very successful in selling the items
<br>
we produce. Cassiopeia Incorporated has started out, and is still to this day, a clothing and accessory store focused on
<br>
young adult females. All of our products are custom designed, so it is always original a part from other clothing/accessory
<br>
stores. If that is not enough, we always have low prices as to make it affordable for those young adults to purchase!
<br>
<br>	
	Cassiopeia Incorporated was founded by a local Californian designer, Jinjoo "Pearl" Kim, who had hoped to create
<br>
a store/ company that allowed girls, who weren't from wealthy families, to still look trendy and in-style without having
<br>
to spend a lot of money. She called it "Cassiopeia", because it was her dear hope that this store would flourish and it would
<br>
expand and become as numerous as the stars like in "Cassiopeia". The first store was opened on January 26th, 1982 on the streets of 
<br>
Los Angelos, California. She started with only three employees besides herself. The store was not an immediate hit, but has attained 
<br>
more renown as time passed on. It wasn't until the late 1980s, that more and more young adults began to recognize and regularly attend 
<br>
to this store.
<br>
<br>	
	With the passing of Ms.Jinjoo "Pearl" Kim on November 7th, 1989, Patty Shin, bought the small company and is now the
<br>
sole owner of it. It is our goal to achieve Ms. Jinjoo "Pearl" Kim's dream to expand the stores than are now under the current company
<br>
name, "Cassiopeia Incorporated". Cassiopeia Incorporated's base is in Los Angelos, California, but we have recently opened a store in
<br>
New York City, New York. We currently have ten employees and four executive personnel over the span of these two locations. Please
<br>
visit any of our two locations if you would like more information about our company.
